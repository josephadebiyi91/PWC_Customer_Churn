## Problem Statement
This dashboard helps the Retention Manager understand their customers better. It helps the manager knows why customers are leaving. Through different ratings, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. It also lets them know the Pecentage Partner, Dependents, PhoneService, thus since by using this dashboard they have identified this problem, they can further work on factors responsible for these churn.

### Steps followed
- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a xls file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present in "TotalCharges" and replace as "0".
- Step 5 : Six cards were add to the visuals indicating the "# of Churn, # of SenCitizen, # of Admin tickets, # of Tech Ticket, Montly, Yearly".
- Step 6 : Pie chart are also use on the visuals to display "Internet Service, Techsupport, Online Security".
- Step 7 : A bar chart was also added to the report design area representing payment method, Tenure, and online backup. 
- Step 8 : Guage Visual was used to represent different ratings mentioned below,
(a) Partner in %

(b) Dependents in %

(c) Phone services in %

- Step 9 : Donut chart Visual was used to represent different ratings mentioned below,
(a) Contract

(b) Multiple Lines

- Step 10 : In the report view, under the insert tab, using shapes option from elements group a rectangle was inserted & similarly using image option company's logo was added to the report design area.
- Step 11 : Calculated column was created in which, customers were grouped into various Tenure rating.
for creating new column following DAX expression was written;

Tenure Rating =

if(tenure<=12, "< 1yrs",

if(tenure<=24, "< 2yrs",

if(tenure<=36, "< 3yrs",

if(tenure<=48, "< 4yrs",

if(tenure<=60, "< 5yrs",

"< 6yrs")))

- Step 12 : Calculated column was created in which, customers were grouped into two # Churn.
for creating new column following DAX expression was written;

#churn =

if(churn = "yes", "1",

"0")))

- Step 13 : New measure was created to find % churn rate.
Following DAX expression was written for the same,

% Churn Rate = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] = "Yes"),COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]),0)






- Step 14 : New measure was created to find Dependents in %,

Following DAX expression was written to find Dependents in %,

Dependents in % = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents] == "Yes", '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] == "Yes"),
    CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] == "Yes")
        
)

- Step 15 : New measure was created to find Month-to-Month,

Following DAX expression was written to find Month-to-Month,

Month-to-Month = CALCULATE(AVERAGEX('01 Churn-Dataset',CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Contract]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Contract] == "month-to-month",'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] == "Yes")))

- Step 16 : New measure was created to calculate Monthly,

Following DAX expression was written to calculate Monthly,

Monthly = SUM('01 Churn-Dataset'[MonthlyCharges])

- Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate MultipleLines in %,

Following DAX expression was written to calculate MultipleLines in %,

MultipleLines in % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[MultipleLines]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[MultipleLines] == "Yes"),
CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[MultipleLines]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] == "Yes"),0
)

- Step 18 : New measure was created to calculate numbAdminTicket,

Following DAX expression was written to calculate numbAdminTicket,

numbAdminTicket = SUM('01 Churn-Dataset'[numAdminTickets])

- Step 19 : New measure was created to calculate numTechTicket,

Following DAX expression was written to calculate numTechTicket,

numTechTicket = CALCULATE(SUM('01 Churn-Dataset'[numTechTickets]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] == "Yes")

- Step 20 : New measure was created to calculate PaperlessBilling in %,

Following DAX expression was written to calculate PaperlessBilling in %,

PaperlessBilling in % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[PaperlessBilling]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[PaperlessBilling] == "Yes",'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] == "Yes"),
CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] == "Yes"),0)

- Step 21 : New measure was created to calculate Partner in %,

)

- Step 23 : New measure was created to calculate Yearly,

Following DAX expression was written to calculate Yearly,

Yearly = SUM('01 Churn-Dataset'[TotalCharges])
